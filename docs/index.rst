Welcome to itinerum-datakit's documentation!
============================================
The itinerum-datakit is a processing library for handling exports from the
Itinerum data collection platform. The datakit provides methods for handling
and cleaning GPS .csv data, processing collected points to trip features,
and writing GIS-compatible files for visualizing results.

The :ref:`QuickStartPage` shows the most common usage patterns of the
datakit library while the :ref:`APIPage` section will detail how to interact
with the library's core methods directly.
