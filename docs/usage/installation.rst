Installation
============

The ``itinerum-datakit`` is currently an early work-in-progress and has not been packaged or versioned. Itinerum-datakit can be used by cloning from:

.. rst-class:: center

http://github.com/TRIP-Lab/itinerum-datakit

and simply copying the ``datakit`` directory into any project you are working on. Project dependencies can be installed with pip::
    
    $ pip install -r datakit/requirements.txt

It is recommended to use a virtualenv to help keep things clean.
